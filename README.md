## Installing Dependencies

Python version: 3.5.0

```bash
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If you need to add new dependencies to the `requirements.txt` file, the easiest way to do so is like so:

```bash
$ pip freeze > requirements.txt
```

which will output your current dependency list to the file.  You should probably only do that if you're using a `virtualenv` to isolate the dependencies for just this project.
